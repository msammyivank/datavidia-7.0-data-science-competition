# Datavidia 7.0 - A National Data Science Competition

Datavidia is part of Arkavidia, a Computer Science competition including Capture the Flag, Competitive Programming, and Data Science fields. I was part of a team with three members in a team named "ELSIX". The field we went into was the "Data Science" field. The competition had 2 phases. The first one is the preliminaries and the second is the finals. The team "ELSIX" made it up to the finals after the preliminaries, however we did not succeed in the finals.
