# Datavidia 7.0 - A National Data Science Competition

Datavidia is part of Arkavidia, a Computer Science competition including Capture the Flag, Competitive Programming, and Data Science fields. I was part of a team with three members in a team named "ELSIX". The field we went into was the "Data Science" field. The competition had 2 phases. The first one is the preliminaries and the second is the finals. The team "ELSIX" made it up to the finals after the preliminaries, however we did not succeed in the finals.

## The Preliminaries
In the preliminaries, we were assigned to do "Sentiment Analysis" about a hotel review dataset, predicting if a review was good or bad in a sense. We had to make a report and a notebook consisting of our syntax used to acquire the results reported. In the process, we did EDA finding emojis, languages, and unique features in the dataset. We made visualizations using typical charts and wordclouds. There's a lot of things that I learned there, including the use of a pre-trained model IndoBERT in order to analyze sentiments in Indonesian, despite some being foreign languages.

## The Finals
In the finals, we were assigned to a prediction task of a music characteristics dataset, predicting the category of each music by their characteristics. In this assignment, we did EDA as well as modelling using tree-based models, the concept of stacking & voting, and reported it in the form of a presentation done to the juries.
